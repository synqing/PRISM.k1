# R3.2 RGB→RGBW Strategy

Owner: Agent 3
Date: TODO

## Problem
Pick a baseline mapping for offline authoring (RGBW tuples) with a path to calibration for future RGBW hardware.

## Options
- HSI→RGBW mapping (current library)
- Whiteness extraction (max/min channels, W channel share)
- Light calibration (white gain, gamma; CCT variants)

## Plan
- Compare on primary/pastel/low-sat colors; check artifacts

## Decision
TODO

## Recommended Action
- Adopt baseline mapping in tooling; define calibration TODOs for RGBW SKU

## Evidence
- Tables/plots; references
