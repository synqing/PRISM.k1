# R1.1 Firmware Decode Budget Envelope (ESP32-S3)

Owner: Agent 1
Date: TODO

## Problem
Establish safe per-frame CPU cycles and memory budget for decoding packed frames at 120 FPS.

## Targets
- 120 FPS, 160 LEDs/channel
- Keep decode + handoff < frame budget with margin

## Plan
- Microbench per-frame decode kernels for candidate encodings
- Measure cycles (esp_cpu_get_cycle_count) and heap usage

## Decision
TODO: Envelope numbers and constraints to feed packaging

## Recommended Action
- Provide limits to R3.4; document constraints for packaging task

## Evidence
- Bench results; code snippets
