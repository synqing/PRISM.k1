# R3.3 Show Family Selection

Owner: Agent 3
Date: TODO

## Problem
Select 2–3 generator families that look great at 160 LEDs, are parameter-rich, and compress well for export.

## Success Criteria
- Visual diversity from small param sets
- Good compressibility (palette+indices/delta)
- Simple offline generation performance

## Candidates
- Phase/wave fields (sine/cosine, phase offsets)
- Noise-based morphs (Perlin/Simplex fields)
- Flow fields / vector fields
- Cellular automata / reaction-diffusion (stretch goal)

## Evaluation Plan
- Generate short sequences; measure per-frame size under candidate encodings
- Rate visual quality and param sensitivity

## Decision
TODO

## Recommended Action
- Adopt top 2–3; define parameter schema; implement first in show_to_prism
