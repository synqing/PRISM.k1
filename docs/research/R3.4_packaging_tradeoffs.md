# R3.4 Packaging Trade-offs for .prism Sequences

Owner: Agent 3 (with input from Agent 1)
Date: TODO

## Problem
Choose encoding(s) for multi-frame sequences balancing size and decode speed at 120 FPS on ESP32-S3.

## Candidates
- Palette + indices
- Delta encoding across frames
- RLE variants / hybrid approaches

## Inputs
- R1.1 decode budget (cycles/memory)
- Typical sequence: 16s @120 FPS, 160 LEDs

## Decision
TODO

## Recommended Action
- Implement chosen encoding in packaging prototype; define constraints to enforce

## Evidence
- Size vs decode cost tables; microbench results
