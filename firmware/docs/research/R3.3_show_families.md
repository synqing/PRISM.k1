# R3.3 Show Family Selection

Owner: Agent 3
Date: TODO

## Problem
Select 2â€“3 generator families that look great at 160 LEDs, are parameter-rich, and compress well for export.

## Success Criteria
- Visual diversity from small param sets
- Good compressibility (palette+indices/delta)
- Simple offline generation performance

## Candidates
- Phase/wave fields (sine/cosine, phase offsets)
- Noise-based morphs (Perlin/Simplex fields)
- Flow fields / vector fields
- Cellular automata / reaction-diffusion (stretch goal)

## Evaluation Plan
- Generate short sequences; measure per-frame size under candidate encodings
- Rate visual quality and param sensitivity

## Decision
Adopt these launch families:
1) Phase/Wave Fields (sine/cosine with spatial phase): minimal CPU, highly parameterizable, compress well with palette+indices.
2) Noise Morphs (Perlin/Simplex value fields mapped along index): organic motion, good variety, moderate compressibility.
3) Flow Fields (2D vector field projected to 1D index): visually rich, still decently compressible with palette+indices.

Parameter schema (baseline):
- Common: duration(s), fps, led_count, palette (hex list), ramp_space, seed
- Waves: amplitude, frequency, speed, direction, phase
- Noise: scale, speed, octaves, persistence, lacunarity
- Flow: field_scale, step_size, speed, curl (optional)

## Recommended Action
- Implement `--show sine|noise|flow` in `tools/show_to_prism.py` with the above parameter schema.
- Emit JSON frames (and CSV as needed) with metadata. Keep design compatible with later .prism packaging.
