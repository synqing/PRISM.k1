# R2.2 Header & CRC Implications

Owner: Agent 2
Date: TODO

## Problem
Validate header layout and CRC coverage when adding metadata fields.

## Plan
- Confirm v1.1 CRC covers first 6 bytes of meta; assess new fields handling

## Decision
Maintain current v1.1 CRC coverage: up to but not including base.crc32, plus first 6 bytes of meta. Additional metadata fields (beyond first 6 bytes) remain outside CRC for backward compatibility.

## Recommended Action
- Document CRC rules and parser behavior explicitly; require toolchain to treat extended metadata as advisory only.
