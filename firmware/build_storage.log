This usually means that "idf.py" was not spawned within an ESP-IDF shell environment or the python virtual environment used by "idf.py" is corrupted.
Please use idf.py only in an ESP-IDF shell environment. If problem persists, please try to install ESP-IDF tools again as described in the Get Started guide.
