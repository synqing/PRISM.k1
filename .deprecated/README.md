# Pre-Knowledge Fortress Archive

**Date Archived:** 2025-10-15
**Archived By:** Agent-Documentation-001 (Knowledge Fortress implementation)
**Reason:** Workspace sterilization before Knowledge Fortress operational use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTICE

**Status:** QUARANTINED - Not validated through Knowledge Fortress process

This folder contains ALL documentation and files that existed BEFORE the Knowledge Fortress system (Phases 1-4) was implemented on 2025-10-15.

**DO NOT USE THESE FILES FOR ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** until they have been reviewed and validated by Captain SpectraSynq through the Knowledge Fortress validation process.

---

## What's Here

### pre-fortress/root/
**Old root-level documentation files:**
- `AGENT.md` - Old agent instructions (duplicate of CLAUDE.md)
- `DELIVERABLES.md` - Multi-agent setup deliverables (dated Oct 15, 2025)
- `STATUS.md` - Project configuration status (point-in-time)
- `TASK_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Task status report (dated Oct 15, 2025)

**Why archived:** Superseded by Knowledge Fortress documentation in `.taskmaster/`

---

### pre-fortress/docs/
**Entire old documentation system** (~20 files + research subfolder)

**Key files:**
- `README.md` - Claimed "SOURCE OF TRUTH" status (superseded by `.taskmaster/CANON.md`)
- `PRISM_AUTHORITATIVE_SPECIFICATION.md` - Old authoritative spec (superseded by CANON.md)
- `firmware_architecture.md` - Module architecture (partially superseded)
- `template_specifications.md` - 15 template pattern specifications
- `template_system_architecture.md` - Template system architecture
- `template_integration_guide.md` - Template integration guide
- `websocket_protocol.md` - Binary TLV WebSocket protocol
- `storage_layout.md` - Partition layout (DEPRECATED per old README)
- `template_catalog.md` - Template catalog (DEPRECATED per old README)
- `TASK_54_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Old task completion report
- `TASK_55_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Old task completion report
- `TASK_56_COMPLETION_REPORT.md` - Old task completion report
- `research/` - 11 old research files (see below)
- [Other specification and documentation files]

**Why archived:** Created before Knowledge Fortress validation framework. Authority unclear. May contain valuable specifications but need review.

---

### pre-fortress/research-needs-validation/
**12 research documents moved from `.taskmaster/research/` lifecycle folders**

**Files:**
1. `forensic_specification_analysis.md` - Specification conflict forensics
2. `esp32_constraints_research.md` - Hardware constraints and capabilities
3. `document_conflict_analysis.md` - Document conflict analysis
4. `upload_handling_research.md` - Upload handling research
5. `power_recovery_research.md` - Power recovery scenarios
6. `websocket_validation.md` - WebSocket validation research
7. `memory_management_deep_dive.md` - Memory management analysis
8. `complexity_analysis_findings.md` - Complexity analysis
9. `critical_risks.md` - Critical risk assessment
10. `binary_security_research.md` - Binary format security
11. `implementation_priority.md` - Implementation prioritization
12. `PHASE_2_SUMMARY.md` - Phase 2 summary document

**Why archived:** These files were moved into `.taskmaster/research/[VALIDATED]/` during Phase 2 reorganization, but they were NOT validated by Captain through the Knowledge Fortress process. They pre-date the Knowledge Fortress system and need proper validation before use.

**Status:** May contain valuable research but MUST go through Knowledge Fortress validation:
1. Review methodology
2. Submit as `[PROPOSED]` research
3. Captain review (`[IN_REVIEW]`)
4. Only use if approved (`[VALIDATED]`)

---

### pre-fortress/tasks/
**56 old task definition files**

**Why archived:** Pre-existing task system, unclear if current or historical. Review needed to determine active vs. superseded tasks.

---

### pre-fortress/reports/
**Old reporting system**

**Why archived:** Superseded by Phase 3/4 completion reports in `.taskmaster/`

---

### pre-fortress/specs/
**Old specifications folder**

**Why archived:** Pre-Knowledge Fortress specification system. Review needed.

---

### pre-fortress/templates/
**Old template system files**

**Why archived:** Unclear relationship to current template specifications. Review needed.

---

## üéØ Authoritative Source (Current)

**DO NOT** use files in `.deprecated/` for active development.

**Current source of truth:** `.taskmaster/CANON.md` (Knowledge Fortress)

**Documentation entry point:** `.taskmaster/README.md`

**Process documentation:**
- `.taskmaster/METHODOLOGY.md` - Research-first process
- `.taskmaster/ADR_GUIDE.md` - How to write ADRs
- `.taskmaster/VALIDATION_GUIDE.md` - Validation procedures

---

## üìã Review Process (When Ready)

After workspace is sterilized and Knowledge Fortress is operational:

### Step 1: Individual Document Review
Review each document in `.deprecated/pre-fortress/` individually to determine:
- Is content still relevant?
- Does it conflict with CANON.md?
- Does it contain valuable specifications?
- Should it be preserved or discarded?

### Step 2: Validation Path Selection

For each relevant document, choose appropriate path:

#### **Option A: Architectural Decision**
If document contains architectural decision:
1. Create new ADR in `.taskmaster/decisions/`
2. Use deprecated doc as reference/evidence
3. Get Captain approval
4. ADR becomes part of CANON

#### **Option B: Research Document**
If document contains research findings:
1. Move to `.taskmaster/research/[PROPOSED]/`
2. Ensure methodology is reproducible
3. Submit for Captain review
4. If approved ‚Üí `.taskmaster/research/[VALIDATED]/`
5. Can then be cited in ADRs

#### **Option C: Extract to CANON**
If document contains constants/specifications:
1. Extract relevant values
2. Create ADR documenting specification
3. Values auto-generated into CANON
4. Code synchronized to CANON

#### **Option D: Convert to Documentation**
If document is pure documentation (no decisions):
1. Extract still-relevant content
2. Integrate into Knowledge Fortress docs
3. Update cross-references

#### **Option E: Discard**
If document is obsolete:
1. Document reason for deprecation
2. Keep in `.deprecated/` for audit trail
3. Do not reference in active code

### Step 3: Validation Gate
**ALL content must pass Captain review** before leaving `.deprecated/`

---

## ‚õî DO NOT

- ‚ùå Reference these documents in active code
- ‚ùå Treat as authoritative specifications
- ‚ùå Use without Captain validation through Knowledge Fortress
- ‚ùå Move files out of `.deprecated/` without review
- ‚ùå Cite in ADRs (not validated)
- ‚ùå Implement features based on these specs

---

## ‚úÖ DO

- ‚úÖ Use as reference during review process
- ‚úÖ Extract valuable specifications through proper channels
- ‚úÖ Preserve for audit trail
- ‚úÖ Reference in NEW research as "prior work"
- ‚úÖ Learn from past approaches
- ‚úÖ Validate before reuse

## üîç Audit Trail

This archive preserves complete history of pre-Knowledge Fortress work:
- **Created:** Various dates (pre-2025-10-15)
- **Archived:** 2025-10-15
- **Reason:** Workspace sterilization before Knowledge Fortress operational use
- **Decision:** Captain SpectraSynq directive for aggressive deprecation
- **Process:** Quarantine all non-Knowledge Fortress content for selective review

**Preservation:** All files preserved exactly as they existed on 2025-10-15 for audit purposes.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (When Ready)

1. **Establish Clean Baseline:** Operate Knowledge Fortress system with clean workspace
2. **Identify Needs:** Determine what specifications/research are actually needed
3. **Selective Review:** Review deprecated content on as-needed basis
4. **Proper Validation:** Route through Knowledge Fortress process
5. **Gradual Integration:** Selectively import validated content

**No rush.** These files are preserved and can be reviewed when needed.

---

**Archive Status:** SEALED
**Review Status:** PENDING (awaiting Captain directive)
**Integrity:** PRESERVED (no modifications to archived content)

---

*This archive enables clean workspace operation while preserving complete audit trail of pre-Knowledge Fortress work.*
