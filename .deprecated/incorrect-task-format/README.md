# Deprecated: Incorrect Task Format

**Deprecated Date:** 2025-10-15
**Reason:** These task files were generated in wrong format (custom markdown instead of task-master's tasks.json)

## What Happened

These 56 task_XXX.txt files were created during an attempt to regenerate tasks with CANON metadata. However, this was done without understanding how task-master actually works.

**The Mistake:**
- Created custom markdown format task files
- Added CANON metadata and YAML specs
- Bypassed task-master's workflow
- Result: Incompatible with task-master MCP tools

**The Correct Approach:**
1. Fix PRD with CANON corrections
2. Run task-master parse-prd to generate tasks.json
3. Let task-master handle task generation
4. Add CANON references post-generation if needed

## Lesson Learned

RTFM (Read The Manual) before building.

---

**Current Status:** Correct tasks.json generated by task-master at .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json
