# Task ID: 014
# Title: Implement pattern delete endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 011, 004
# Priority: medium
# CANON ADRs: ADR-005
# CANON Validated: 2025-10-15

## Description
Create DELETE handler with index cleanup for patterns in /littlefs storage.

## CANON Specifications
```yaml
# ADR-005: Delete Paths
patterns_dir: "/littlefs/patterns"  # NOT /prism/patterns
index_path: "/littlefs/.index.json"

# Response Codes
success: 200
not_found: 404
server_error: 500
```

## Details
Parse UUID from URI path. Check file exists at **/littlefs/patterns/<uuid>.prism**. Delete file with prism_fs_delete(). Update **/littlefs/.index.json** to remove entry. Return 404 if not found, 200 on success.

## Test Strategy
1. Delete existing pattern, verify file removed
2. Verify /littlefs/.index.json updated
3. Test deleting non-existent returns 404
4. Verify disk space reclaimed
5. Test concurrent delete requests

## Agent Guidance
1. Implement DELETE /api/patterns/:id
2. Parse UUID from URI
3. Build path: /littlefs/patterns/<uuid>.prism
4. Delete file via prism_fs_delete()
5. Update /littlefs/.index.json
6. Return appropriate status code

## Success Criteria
- [x] Delete removes file from /littlefs
- [x] Index updated correctly
- [x] 404 for non-existent patterns
- [x] 200 on success
