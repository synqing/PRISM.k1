# Implementation Priority Matrix

**Generated:** 2025-10-15
**Purpose:** Define implementation order based on dependencies and risk mitigation
**Critical Path:** Components that block everything else

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (CRITICAL):** Blocks everything, do first
- **P1 (HIGH):** Blocks major features
- **P2 (MEDIUM):** Important but not blocking
- **P3 (LOW):** Nice to have, do last

## P0: CRITICAL - Memory Infrastructure (Must Complete First)

These MUST be implemented before ANY other code:

| Component | Why Critical | Time | Dependencies | Files to Create |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Memory Pool Manager | Prevents fragmentation death | 1 day | None | `components/core/memory_pool.c` |
| Error Handler | Graceful failure required | 4 hours | Memory Pool | `components/core/error_handler.c` |
| System Monitor | Stack/heap monitoring | 4 hours | Memory Pool | `components/core/system_monitor.c` |

### Implementation Order:

```c
Day 1 Morning:
1. memory_pool.c - Fixed allocators (4 hours)
2. memory_pool_test.c - Validation (2 hours)

Day 1 Afternoon:
3. error_handler.c - Error codes, recovery (2 hours)
4. system_monitor.c - Health tracking (2 hours)
```

**CRITICAL:** No other component can be started until memory infrastructure is complete and tested.

## P0: CRITICAL - Core System (Must Complete Second)

| Component | Why Critical | Time | Dependencies | Files to Create |
|-----------|-------------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| FreeRTOS Config | Task/queue setup | 2 hours | Memory Pool | `main/app_init.c` |
| Watchdog Setup | Prevent hangs | 1 hour | Error Handler | `components/core/watchdog.c` |
| NVS Init | Settings storage | 1 hour | None | `components/core/nvs_manager.c` |

## P1: HIGH - Network Foundation

Can start AFTER memory infrastructure:

| Component | Why P1 | Time | Dependencies | Parallel? |
|-----------|--------|------|--------------|-----------|
| WiFi Manager | Connection required | 1 day | Memory Pool | Yes |
| mDNS Service | Discovery | 2 hours | WiFi Manager | No |
| Network Monitor | Reconnection | 4 hours | WiFi Manager | No |

### Parallel Team A Can Work On:
```
components/network/
├── wifi_manager.c      [8 hours]
├── mdns_service.c      [2 hours]
└── network_monitor.c   [4 hours]
```

## P1: HIGH - Storage Foundation

Can start AFTER memory infrastructure:

| Component | Why P1 | Time | Dependencies | Parallel? |
|-----------|--------|------|--------------|-----------|
| LittleFS Init | Pattern storage | 4 hours | Memory Pool | Yes |
| Pattern Format | .prism parser | 1 day | Memory Pool | Yes |
| Cache Manager | <100ms switching | 1 day | Pattern Format | No |

### Parallel Team B Can Work On:
```
components/storage/
├── littlefs_init.c     [4 hours]
├── pattern_format.c    [8 hours]
└── cache_manager.c     [8 hours]
```

## P1: HIGH - WebSocket Implementation

MUST WAIT for Network Foundation:

| Component | Why P1 | Time | Dependencies |
|-----------|--------|------|--------------|
| WebSocket Server | Upload/control | 2 days | WiFi, Memory Pool |
| Protocol Parser | TLV handling | 1 day | Memory Pool |
| Session Manager | Resume capability | 4 hours | Protocol Parser |

**CRITICAL Decision:** Based on research, MUST implement:
- Fixed 4KB frames
- Binary TLV protocol
- Memory pool usage (no malloc)
- Single connection only

## P2: MEDIUM - LED Playback

Can start AFTER storage works:

| Component | Why P2 | Time | Dependencies |
|-----------|--------|------|--------------|
| RMT Driver | LED output | 1 day | Memory Pool |
| Effect Engine | Pattern playback | 2 days | Pattern Format |
| Animation Timer | 60 FPS timing | 4 hours | RMT Driver |

## P3: LOW - Templates & Polish

DEAD LAST - needs everything:

| Component | Why P3 | Time | Dependencies |
|-----------|--------|------|--------------|
| Template Patterns | Hardcoded effects | 2 days | Effect Engine |
| Template Loader | Pattern deployment | 1 day | Storage, WebSocket |
| OTA Updates | Field updates | 1 day | Network |

## Dependency Graph

```
Memory Pool Manager
    ├── Error Handler
    │   └── System Monitor
    │       └── Watchdog
    └── [ENABLES ALL OTHER COMPONENTS]
        ├── WiFi Manager
        │   ├── mDNS Service
        │   └── WebSocket Server
        │       └── Protocol Parser
        │           └── Session Manager
        ├── LittleFS Init
        │   └── Pattern Format
        │       └── Cache Manager
        │           └── Effect Engine
        │               └── Template Patterns
        └── RMT Driver
            └── Animation Timer
```

## Critical Path (Sequential, Cannot Parallelize)

```
1. Memory Pool Manager (1 day)
   ↓
2. Error Handler (4 hours)
   ↓
3. WiFi Manager (1 day)
   ↓
4. WebSocket Server (2 days)
   ↓
5. Protocol Parser (1 day)
= 5 days minimum before pattern upload works
```

## Parallel Paths (Can Do Simultaneously)

### Team A: Network Path
```
Memory Pool → WiFi → mDNS → WebSocket → Protocol
Total: 4 days
```

### Team B: Storage Path
```
Memory Pool → LittleFS → Pattern Format → Cache
Total: 3 days
```

### Team C: Playback Path
```
Memory Pool → RMT Driver → Animation Timer
Total: 1.5 days
```

## Risk-Based Priority Adjustments

Based on risk analysis, these components get PROMOTED:

| Component | Original | New | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|-----|
| Memory Pool | P1 | P0 | Fragmentation kills devices |
| System Monitor | P2 | P0 | Need early warning |
| Error Handler | P2 | P0 | Graceful degradation critical |
| Cache Manager | P2 | P1 | Pattern lag = angry customers |

## Implementation Rules

### MUST Follow

1. **No malloc() after init** - Only memory pools
2. **Check return values** - Every function
3. **Bounds check everything** - No assumptions
4. **Test each component** - Before moving on
5. **Monitor resources** - From day one

### MUST NOT Do

1. **Skip memory pools** - Will fragment
2. **Dynamic buffers** - Will fragment
3. **Assume success** - Check everything
4. **Defer monitoring** - Need visibility
5. **Rush foundation** - Gets exponentially harder to fix

## Validation Gates

### Gate 1: Memory Infrastructure (Day 1)
- [ ] Memory pools allocate successfully
- [ ] No memory leaks in 1-hour test
- [ ] Error handler catches failures
- [ ] Monitor reports accurate metrics

### Gate 2: Network Foundation (Day 3)
- [ ] WiFi connects and reconnects
- [ ] mDNS advertises service
- [ ] Backoff algorithm works

### Gate 3: WebSocket Protocol (Day 5)
- [ ] Binary messages parse correctly
- [ ] 4KB frames transfer successfully
- [ ] Memory pools used (no malloc)
- [ ] CRC validation works

### Gate 4: Storage System (Day 6)
- [ ] LittleFS mounts
- [ ] Patterns save/load
- [ ] Cache provides <100ms switching

### Gate 5: Full Integration (Day 10)
- [ ] Pattern upload via WebSocket works
- [ ] LED output displays patterns
- [ ] 24-hour stability test passes

## Resource Allocation

### If Solo Developer
Follow critical path strictly:
1. Memory (1 day)
2. Network (2 days)
3. WebSocket (3 days)
4. Storage (2 days)
5. Playback (2 days)
Total: 10 days

### If 2-Person Team
- Developer A: Memory → Network → WebSocket
- Developer B: Memory → Storage → Playback
Total: 6 days

### If 3-Person Team
- Developer A: Memory → Network path
- Developer B: Memory → Storage path
- Developer C: Memory → Playback path
Total: 4 days

## Success Metrics

Implementation is successful when:

1. **Memory stable:** 72-hour test, no fragmentation
2. **Network reliable:** Reconnects gracefully
3. **Protocol working:** 500KB/s sustained
4. **Storage functional:** 30 patterns stored
5. **Playback smooth:** 60 FPS maintained
6. **No crashes:** 24-hour stress test

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT proceed to next component until current passes validation gate.
