# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement curve interpolation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add smooth interpolation between pattern keyframes
# Details:
Support linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out curves. Use fixed-point math for efficiency. Implement cubic bezier for smooth transitions. Cache calculated values where possible.

# Test Strategy:
Verify interpolation produces smooth values; test all curve types; benchmark performance
