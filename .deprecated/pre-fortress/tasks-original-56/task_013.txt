# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement pattern list endpoint
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create GET /api/patterns handler that returns JSON array of stored patterns
# Details:
Read /prism/.index.json, parse with cJSON, build response array with: uuid, name, size, uploadTime, duration. Set Content-Type: application/json. Handle empty index gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Upload 3 patterns, verify list returns all 3 with correct metadata; test with empty storage
