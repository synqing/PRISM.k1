# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement core filesystem operations (prism_fs)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create filesystem abstraction layer with LittleFS mounting, atomic operations, and index management
# Details:
Implement prism_fs_init() with esp_vfs_littlefs_register(), format_if_mount_failed=true. Create atomic commit pattern: write to .tmp file, fsync, rename. Implement index operations using cJSON for metadata storage at /prism/.index.json.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test: mount/unmount cycle, create/rename/delete file operations, verify atomic rename works correctly
