# Task ID: 43
# Title: Create monorepo structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 38
# Priority: low
# Description: Organize code into monorepo with clear separation
# Details:
Structure: apps/studio/ (Tauri), firmware/ (ESP-IDF), libs/pattern/ (shared Rust), specs/ (documentation). Set up workspace Cargo.toml, shared dependencies, cross-compilation scripts.

# Test Strategy:
All components build independently, shared libs link correctly
