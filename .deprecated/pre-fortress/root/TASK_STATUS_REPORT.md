# PRISM.K1 Task Status Report
Generated: 2025-10-15

## Summary
- **Total Pending Tasks**: 53
- **High Priority**: 24
- **Medium Priority**: 22
- **Low Priority**: 7

## Critical Path Analysis

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Based on Filesystem Evidence)
1. **Task #001**: Initialize ESP-IDF v5.x project structure
   - Status: COMPLETE - Project structure created with CMakeLists.txt, main component, sdkconfig.defaults
   - Evidence: /firmware directory fully structured with all ESP-IDF requirements

### üöÄ READY TO START (No Dependencies or Dependencies Met)

#### High Priority - Immediate Action
1. **Task #002**: Configure partition table with LittleFS
   - Dependencies: Task #1 (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
   - Current: partitions.csv exists but needs LittleFS configuration
   - Action: Update partition table for LittleFS support

2. **Task #003**: Add LittleFS managed component
   - Dependencies: Task #1 (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
   - Action: Add esp_littlefs to idf_component.yml

3. **Task #005**: Implement hash functions (prism_hash)
   - Dependencies: Task #1 (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
   - Action: Create components/core/prism_hash.c with CRC32 and SHA256

4. **Task #006**: Create error code system (prism_errors)
   - Dependencies: Task #1 (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
   - Action: Create components/core/include/prism_errors.h

5. **Task #009**: Generate self-signed certificate for HTTPS
   - Dependencies: Task #1 (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
   - Action: Generate cert.pem and key.pem for HTTPS server

### ‚è≥ BLOCKED (Waiting on Dependencies)

#### Critical Path Items
1. **Task #004**: Implement core filesystem operations (prism_fs)
   - Blocked by: Tasks #2, #3 (LittleFS setup)

2. **Task #007**: Implement binary file format parser
   - Blocked by: Tasks #5, #6 (hash functions, error system)

3. **Task #010**: Initialize HTTPS server
   - Blocked by: Task #9 (certificate generation)

4. **Task #036**: Create walking skeleton WebSocket MVP
   - Blocked by: Tasks #1 (‚úÖ), #2, #3
   - This is a HIGH VALUE task for early validation

### üìä Task Priority Matrix

#### Do First (High Impact, Unblocked)
- Task #002: Configure partition table with LittleFS
- Task #003: Add LittleFS managed component
- Task #005: Implement hash functions
- Task #006: Create error code system
- Task #009: Generate self-signed certificate

#### Do Next (Unlocks Many Tasks)
- Task #004: Core filesystem operations (unlocks 8+ tasks)
- Task #007: Binary file parser (unlocks pattern system)
- Task #010: HTTPS server (unlocks all REST endpoints)

#### Do Later (Lower Dependencies)
- Task #026: mDNS service discovery
- Task #035: Documentation
- Task #053: Node editor experimental feature

## Next Immediate Actions

Based on completed specifications and current state:

1. **Update Task #001 Status**: Mark as complete in task system
2. **Start Task #002**: Configure partition table with LittleFS
3. **Start Task #003**: Add LittleFS managed component
4. **Start Task #005**: Implement hash functions in parallel

## Notes
- The firmware project structure is initialized and ready for component implementation
- With specifications complete, all firmware tasks can now proceed with clear requirements
- Focus on unlocking Task #036 (Walking Skeleton MVP) for early validation
- Consider parallel execution of independent tasks #002, #003, #005, #006
