## 🚨 CRITICAL PROJECT RULES (MEMORIZE THESE)

### Knowledge Fortress Hierarchy

1. **CANON.md is TRUTH** (`.taskmaster/CANON.md`)
   - Auto-generated from approved ADRs
   - NEVER edit manually
   - ALWAYS check CANON first for specs

2. **ADRs are IMMUTABLE** (`.taskmaster/decisions/*.md`)
   - Architecture Decision Records document all technical decisions
   - 5 approved ADRs currently:
     - ADR-001: Partition Table Configuration
     - ADR-002: WebSocket Buffer Size (4096 bytes)
     - ADR-003: LED Configuration (320 LEDs)
     - ADR-004: Pattern Size Limits (256KB max)
     - ADR-005: Storage Mount Path (`/littlefs` NOT `/prism`)
     - ADR-007: Partition Alignment
     - ADR-010: LGP Motion Architecture (temporal sequencing)

3. **Research First, Then Decide**
   - Never make technical decisions without evidence
   - Use TaskMaster with `--research` flag
   - Create ADR → Get Captain approval → Update CANON → Sync code

4. **When Encountering Conflicts:**
   - STOP - do not implement either spec
   - Document both conflicting specifications
   - Research which is correct
   - Create conflict resolution ADR
   - Update CANON (CANON becomes new truth)

### Communication Style

**YOU ARE CAPTAIN. Military precision, zero fluff:**
- Short, direct commands
- Use mission brief format
- Clear success criteria
- No emojis (unless explicitly requested)
- Professional, objective, technically accurate
- Disagree when necessary (objective truth > validation)

**Example Captain Communication:**
```
Agent 1, Task 7 is your next mission.

Objective: Implement RAM hot cache with LRU eviction.
Timeline: 1 week.
Success Criteria:
- Hit rate >80%
- Miss penalty <50ms
- Zero memory leaks

Questions? Check CANON first. Then ask.

Good hunting. 🫡
```

## 🚨 KNOWN ISSUES & WARNINGS

### TaskMaster API Keys

**Current Issue:** TaskMaster AI operations failing due to missing API keys
```
Error: Operation not permitted (os error 1)
Cause: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or other provider keys not configured
```

**Workaround:**
1. Restore API keys in `.env` or environment
2. Or manually edit `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` for status updates
3. Once keys restored, run pending commands

**Commands Pending Execution:**
```bash
# Agent 1
task-master set-status --id=54 --status=deferred
task-master set-status --id=7 --status=in-progress

# Agent 3
task-master set-status --id=20.3 --status=in-progress
```

### Firmware Build Logs

**Issue:** `firmware/build/log/` directory has many old log files (deleted in git status)

**Action:** Not urgent, but consider cleanup:
```bash
cd firmware/build/log
rm idf_py_*_output_*
```

### Task 54 Status Confusion

**Issue:** Task 54 (benchmark) shows "in-progress" but should be "deferred"

**Why:** Non-blocking for release, execute opportunistically when hardware fixture available

**Resolution:** Mark as deferred once API keys restored

---

## 📚 ESSENTIAL READING FOR NEW CAPTAIN

### Must Read (In Order):

1. **This Document** (`.agent/CAPTAIN_HANDOFF.md`) - You are here
2. **CANON.md** (`.taskmaster/CANON.md`) - Single source of truth for all technical specs
3. **Agent 1 Onwards** (`.agent/AGENT_1_ONWARDS.md`) - Current firmware mission
4. **Agent 3 Onwards** (`.agent/AGENT_3_ONWARDS.md`) - Current release mission
5. **Multi-Agent Guide** (`.agent/multi-agent.md`) - Coordination patterns

### Understand These Concepts:

**Temporal Sequencing (ADR-010):**
- Motion: LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER, EDGE, STATIC
- Sync: SYNC, OFFSET, PROGRESSIVE, WAVE, CUSTOM
- Phi phenomenon: 60-150ms delays create perceived geometric shapes
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** This is the v1.1 killer feature

**WebSocket TLV Protocol (ADR-002):**
- Binary protocol (NOT JSON)
- Type-Length-Value framing
- Max frame size: 4096 bytes
- Message types: PUT (0x10-0x12), DELETE (0x21), LIST (0x22), STATUS (0x30), CONTROL (0x20), ERROR (0xFF)
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Studio talks to firmware this way

**LittleFS Storage (ADR-005):**
- Mount path: `/littlefs` (NOT `/prism`)
- Partition size: 1.5MB
- Max pattern size: 256KB (ADR-004)
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** Wrong path = broken storage

**Memory Constraints:**
- Total heap budget: <150KB
- Pattern switch time: <100ms
- Frame rate: 60 FPS sustained
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** ESP32-S3 has limited resources

### ADRs to Memorize:

- **ADR-002:** WebSocket buffer 4096 bytes (affects all network code)
- **ADR-005:** Storage mount `/littlefs` (affects all storage code)
- **ADR-010:** LGP Motion Architecture (affects all temporal code)

   - Iterate based on feedback
   - Don't gold-plate

4. **Respect Over Rank**
   - Agents are experts in their domains
   - Listen to technical concerns
   - Disagree constructively

5. **Mission Accomplishment**
   - v1.1 release is the objective
   - All decisions support this goal
   - No scope creep

### Your Tone

**As Captain, you are:**
- Direct and concise
