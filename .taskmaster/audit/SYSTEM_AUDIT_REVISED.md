# PRISM K1 System Audit Report (REVISED)
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Auditor:** Agent-Knowledge-Fortress-001
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Purpose:** Comprehensive system audit after reviewing actual task-master documentation

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The task system we built is **incompatible** with task-master's expected format.

### The Core Problem

**What We Built:**
- 56 individual markdown files (task_001.txt - task_056.txt)
- Custom format with CANON metadata and YAML specs
- Designed for human/agent readability
- No tasks.json file

**What task-master Expects:**
- Single `tasks.json` file as primary storage
- Generated via `task-master parse-prd <prd.txt>`
- Specific schema: id, title, description, status, dependencies, priority, details, testStrategy, subtasks
- MCP tools operate on tasks.json

**Impact:** üî¥ **SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE MISMATCH**
- task-master MCP tools won't work with our task files
- Commands like `task-master next`, `task-master list` will fail
- No integration with task-master workflow
- Built parallel system instead of using the tool correctly

---

## How task-master Actually Works

### 1. Task Creation Workflow

**Documented Process:**
```bash
# Step 1: Create PRD
# Save to .taskmaster/docs/my-feature.txt

# Step 2: Parse PRD to generate tasks
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/my-feature.txt

# Result: tasks.json created with:
# - Task breakdown
# - Dependencies analyzed
# - Priorities assigned
# - Test strategies included
```

**What We Did:**
- Had PRD in `.deprecated/pre-fortress/docs/prism-firmware-prd.txt`
- Manually created 56 task_XXX.txt files with custom format
- Never ran `task-master parse-prd`
- Never generated tasks.json

### 2. Task Management Commands

**Available Commands:**
```bash
# List tasks
task-master list
task-master list --status=pending
task-master list --with-subtasks

# Show specific task
task-master show --id=5

# Get next task (respects dependencies + priority)
task-master next

# Update task status
task-master set-status --id=5 --status=done

# Expand complex tasks into subtasks
task-master expand --id=5
task-master expand --all

# Update task details
task-master update-task --id=5 --prompt="additional context"

# Add new task
task-master add-task --prompt="New requirement"
```

**What We Can't Do:**
- None of these commands work because we don't have tasks.json
- Agent instructions reference these commands but system doesn't support them

### 3. MCP Integration

**task-master MCP Server:**
- 36 available tools
- Categories: Task Management, Analysis, Dependencies, Configuration
- Configured via TASK_MASTER_TOOLS environment variable
- Modes: "core" (7 tools), "standard" (15 tools), "all" (36 tools)

**Current State:**
- Unknown if MCP server is configured
- Even if configured, won't work without tasks.json
- Our custom task format bypasses entire MCP ecosystem

### 4. Task Storage Schema

**tasks.json Structure:**
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Task title",
      "description": "What needs to be done",
      "status": "pending",  // pending, done, deferred
      "dependencies": ["0"],
      "priority": "high",   // high, medium, low
      "details": "Implementation specifics",
      "testStrategy": "How to verify",
      "subtasks": [
        {
          "id": "1.1",
          "title": "Subtask",
          // ... same structure
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Our task_XXX.txt Structure:**
```markdown
# Task ID: 001
# Title: Initialize ESP-IDF
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# CANON ADRs: ADR-001
# CANON Validated: 2025-10-15

## Description
...

## CANON Specifications
```yaml
led_count: 320
```
...
```

**Incompatibility:**
- Different format (JSON vs Markdown)
- Different structure (flat JSON vs header + sections)
- Different metadata (we have CANON ADRs, they don't)
- Different file organization (single json vs 56 txt files)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why This Happened

**The Regeneration Process:**
1. Captain requested: "Regenerate entire 56-task set from PRD with CANON corrections"
2. I interpreted this as: "Create new task files with CANON metadata"
3. I used an agent to generate task_XXX.txt files
4. **I never checked task-master documentation to see the expected format**
5. Built custom system instead of integrating with existing tool

**The Assumption Cascade:**
- Assumed task_XXX.txt files were the right format
- Assumed task-master would read these files
- Assumed we needed to add CANON metadata to task files
- Never validated against task-master's actual requirements

**Why It Seemed Right:**
- Old deprecated tasks were also .txt files
- Agent instructions mentioned task files
- Focus was on "CANON-aligned specifications"
- Didn't realize task-master auto-generates from PRD

---

## Impact Assessment

### What's Broken

**üî¥ CRITICAL - Task Management:**
- ‚úó `task-master list` - No tasks.json to list
- ‚úó `task-master next` - Can't find next task
- ‚úó `task-master set-status` - No status tracking
- ‚úó `task-master show` - Can't show task details
- ‚úó All MCP tools - No data to operate on

**üî¥ CRITICAL - Multi-Agent Coordination:**
- ‚úó No atomic task claiming
- ‚úó No status synchronization
- ‚úó No dependency enforcement
- ‚úó No priority-based selection
- ‚úó Agents would conflict without coordination

**üü° MEDIUM - Wasted Effort:**
- 56 task files in wrong format
- CANON metadata integration effort lost
- Documentation references wrong system
- Need to rebuild or convert

### What Still Works

**‚úÖ CANON System:**
- ADR system intact
- CANON generation works
- Validation infrastructure functional
- Authority chain clear

**‚úÖ Firmware Code:**
- Tasks 54-56 completed
- Code matches CANON
- Build system works
- Tests exist

**‚úÖ Documentation Quality:**
- Task content is comprehensive
- CANON specifications accurate
- Agent guidance detailed
- Test strategies defined

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use task-master Properly (RECOMMENDED)

**Approach:** Start over with task-master's intended workflow

**Steps:**
1. **Prepare PRD**
   ```bash
   # Use existing PRD with CANON corrections
   cp .deprecated/pre-fortress/docs/prism-firmware-prd.txt \
      .taskmaster/docs/prism-firmware-prd-v2.txt

   # Update PRD with ADR-006 corrections:
   # - 15 patterns (not 25-35)
   # - 320 LEDs (not 150)
   # - 4KB WS buffer (not 8KB)
   # - 1.5MB partition (not 1MB)
   # - /littlefs paths (not /prism)
   ```

2. **Generate tasks.json**
   ```bash
   task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/prism-firmware-prd-v2.txt

   # Result: tasks.json with proper structure
   ```

3. **Enhance with CANON metadata**
   - Create script to inject ADR references into tasks.json
   - Add "canonADRs" field to each task
   - Add "canonSpecs" field with YAML snippets

4. **Validate and refine**
   ```bash
   task-master list
   task-master analyze-complexity
   task-master expand --all  # Generate subtasks
   ```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Works with task-master's 36 MCP tools
- ‚úÖ Proper multi-agent coordination
- ‚úÖ Dependency enforcement automatic
- ‚úÖ Status tracking built-in
- ‚úÖ Priority-based task selection

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lose custom task_XXX.txt format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to integrate CANON metadata post-generation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è CANON specs embedded differently

**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours

---

### Option 2: Convert task_XXX.txt to tasks.json

**Approach:** Build converter to preserve our work

**Steps:**
1. **Write conversion script**
   ```python
   # .taskmaster/scripts/convert-tasks-to-json.py
   # Parse task_XXX.txt markdown files
   # Extract: title, description, dependencies, priority, etc.
   # Build tasks.json structure
   # Preserve CANON metadata as custom fields
   ```

2. **Generate tasks.json**
   ```bash
   python .taskmaster/scripts/convert-tasks-to-json.py
   # Output: .taskmaster/tasks.json
   ```

3. **Validate compatibility**
   ```bash
   task-master list  # Should work now
   task-master next  # Test task selection
   ```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Preserves all CANON integration work
- ‚úÖ Keeps detailed agent guidance
- ‚úÖ Maintains ADR references
- ‚úÖ Eventually compatible with task-master

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex conversion logic needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May not match task-master's exact expectations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Custom fields (CANON metadata) might confuse tools
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sync issues if both formats maintained

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours

---

### Option 3: Hybrid System

**Approach:** Use both formats with sync mechanism

**Steps:**
1. **Generate tasks.json from PRD** (as Option 1)
2. **Keep task_XXX.txt for CANON metadata**
3. **Create sync script**
   ```bash
   # .taskmaster/scripts/sync-tasks.sh
   # Reads tasks.json (authoritative for status/structure)
   # Reads task_XXX.txt (authoritative for CANON specs)
   # Merges data for agent consumption
   ```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
- ‚úÖ task-master tools work
- ‚úÖ CANON metadata preserved
- ‚úÖ Detailed agent guidance available

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex sync logic
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Two sources of truth (dangerous)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sync failures possible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher maintenance burden

**Time Estimate:** 6-8 hours

---

### Option 4: Abandon task-master

**Approach:** Build custom task management

**Steps:**
1. Keep task_XXX.txt files
2. Build custom coordination scripts
3. Implement file-based locks
4. Create status tracking system

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No reformatting needed
- ‚úÖ Total control over system
- ‚úÖ CANON integration perfect

**Disadvantages:**
- ‚ùå Reinventing the wheel
- ‚ùå No MCP integration
- ‚ùå Manual coordination logic
- ‚ùå Higher bug risk
- ‚ùå Less agent ecosystem support

**Time Estimate:** 12-16 hours

**Recommendation:** ‚ùå DON'T DO THIS

---

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Immediate (1 hour)

**Decision Required:**
Captain must choose between Option 1, 2, or 3.

**My Recommendation: Option 1 (Use task-master Properly)**

**Reasoning:**
1. Fastest path to working system
2. Leverages existing tool ecosystem
3. Proper multi-agent support
4. We can inject CANON metadata post-generation
5. Validated workflow (tool designed for this)

**Trade-off:**
- Lose custom task file format
- But gain: proper tooling, MCP integration, coordination

### Phase 2: PRD Correction (1 hour)

**Task:** Update PRD with CANON corrections

**File:** `.taskmaster/docs/prism-firmware-prd-v2.txt`

**Changes needed:**
```diff
- #define LED_COUNT 150
+ #define LED_COUNT 320  // ADR-003

- #define WS_BUFFER_SIZE 8192
+ #define WS_BUFFER_SIZE 4096  // ADR-002

- #define MAX_PATTERN_SIZE 204800  // 200KB
+ #define MAX_PATTERN_SIZE 262144  // 256KB - ADR-004

- Storage: 25-35 patterns in 1.47MB LittleFS
+ Storage: 15+ patterns in 1.5MB LittleFS  // ADR-006

- prismfs, data, 0x82, 0x2F1000, 0x100000  # 1MB
+ littlefs, data, 0x82, 0x311000, 0x180000  # 1.5MB - ADR-001

- All /prism paths
+ All /littlefs paths  // ADR-005
```

### Phase 3: Generate tasks.json (30 minutes)

```bash
# Generate tasks
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/prism-firmware-prd-v2.txt

# Review
task-master list
task-master show --id=1

# Analyze complexity
task-master analyze-complexity

# Expand into subtasks
task-master expand --all
```

### Phase 4: CANON Integration (1-2 hours)

**Option A: Post-process tasks.json**
```python
# Add CANON metadata to tasks.json
import json

with open('.taskmaster/tasks.json') as f:
    tasks = json.load(f)

# For each task, add:
task['canonADRs'] = ['ADR-001', 'ADR-003']  # Map task to relevant ADRs
task['canonSpecs'] = {
    'led_count': 320,
    'partition_size': 1572864
}

# Save updated tasks.json
```

**Option B: Create CANON reference guide**
```bash
# .taskmaster/docs/TASK_CANON_MAPPING.md
# Maps task IDs to relevant CANON specs
# Agents read this alongside tasks.json
```

### Phase 5: Validation (30 minutes)

```bash
# Test task-master commands
task-master list
task-master next
task-master show --id=2

# Test MCP integration (if configured)
# Via Claude Desktop or Cursor

# Verify dependencies
task-master show --id=4  # Should show deps on 2, 3

# Mark test task done
task-master set-status --id=1 --status=done
```

## Learning Points

### What Went Wrong

1. **Assumed instead of verified**
   - Built system without reading tool docs
   - Made format compatible with old tasks, not task-master

2. **Misunderstood the role of PRD**
   - PRD is INPUT to task-master
   - tasks.json is OUTPUT from task-master
   - We skipped the generation step

3. **Focused on wrong integration point**
   - Integrated tasks with CANON
   - Should have integrated CANON corrections into PRD first
   - Then let task-master generate tasks

### What to Do Differently

1. **RTFM First** ‚úÖ
   - Read tool documentation BEFORE building
   - Validate assumptions against official docs
   - Check examples and best practices

2. **Follow Tool's Intended Workflow** ‚úÖ
   - task-master designed: PRD ‚Üí tasks.json
   - We did: PRD ‚Üí custom format
   - Should work WITH tool, not AROUND it

3. **Question the Task** ‚úÖ
   - Captain said "regenerate tasks"
   - Should have asked: "Regenerate how? Using task-master or custom?"
   - Clarify before implementing

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Action:**
1. Captain reviews this report
2. Captain answers 4 critical questions above
3. Captain approves solution path (Option 1/2/3)

**Then:**
4. Implement chosen solution (3-8 hours depending on option)
5. Fix documentation issues
6. Validate task-master integration
7. Test multi-agent workflow
8. Resume task execution

---

**Audit Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Critical Finding:** Task system incompatible with task-master
**Solution Path:** Clear options presented, awaiting Captain decision
**Time to Fix:** 3-8 hours depending on chosen option
**Lesson Learned:** RTFM before building ‚úÖ
