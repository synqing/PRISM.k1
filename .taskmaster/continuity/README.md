## DECISION TREE: Which Document to Read?

```
Are you a NEW agent taking over?
├─ Yes → Read CONTEXT_PROMPT.md first
│         Then read QUICK_START.md
│         Then start implementing
│
└─ No → Are you ALREADY up to speed?
        ├─ Yes → Just need to check progress?
        │         └─→ Read IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md
        │             section "CURRENT PROGRESS TRACKER"
        │
        └─ No → Need to understand the mission?
                ├─ Want quick version?
                │   └─→ Read QUICK_START.md

## CRITICAL FILES IN PROJECT

Beyond this continuity folder, you'll work with:

### Configuration Files (Phase 1)
```
firmware/sdkconfig.defaults       ← WS_BUFFER_SIZE needs fix
firmware/partitions.csv           ← Offset needs fix
```

### ADR System (Phase 1-2)
```
.taskmaster/decisions/            ← Create ADRs here
.taskmaster/CANON.md              ← Auto-generated truth
```

### Research System (Phase 2)
```
.taskmaster/research/
  [PROPOSED]/                     ← Unvalidated research
  [IN_REVIEW]/                    ← Being peer reviewed
  [VALIDATED]/                    ← Ready for ADR
  [REJECTED]/                     ← Failed validation
  [ARCHIVED]/                     ← Superseded

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS

**Check if continuity docs are complete:**
```bash
cd /Users/spectrasynq/Workspace_Management/Software/PRISM.k1/.taskmaster/continuity
ls -1 | wc -l  # Should be 5 (including this README)
```

**Check current mission progress:**
```bash
grep -A 40 "CURRENT PROGRESS TRACKER" IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md
```

**Verify project structure:**
```bash
cd /Users/spectrasynq/Workspace_Management/Software/PRISM.k1
ls -la .taskmaster/
```

**Check for conflicting specs (the original problem):**
```bash
grep -r "LED_COUNT" .taskmaster/docs/
grep -r "WS_BUFFER_SIZE" firmware/
```
