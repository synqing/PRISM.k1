# Task ID: 9
# Title: Generate self-signed certificate for HTTPS
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and embed self-signed certificate for HTTPS server
# Details:
Generate 2048-bit RSA certificate with: openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server_key.pem -out server_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes. Embed as string literals in prism_http.c. Consider future certificate provisioning mechanism.

# Test Strategy:
Verify certificate loads correctly; test HTTPS connection with curl -k; check certificate details with openssl x509
