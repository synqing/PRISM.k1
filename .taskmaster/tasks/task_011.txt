# Task ID: 11
# Title: Integrate Wireframes with Task Plan
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Map the new wireframe prototype to tasks, align acceptance criteria, and ensure component/interaction parity across Timeline, Device Manager, and Bake→Upload flows.
# Details:
Source: User-Facing App Wireframes 3 (local code bundle) and Figma link in README. Produce a traceability matrix linking wireframe screens/components to tasks/subtasks, update acceptance criteria in tasks to reference wireframe states, and flag any gaps as follow-up tasks.

# Test Strategy:
Traceability matrix present; reviewers can click from each task to the corresponding wireframe section. Acceptance criteria updated to reference specific screen states. All gaps are captured as subtasks or new tasks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create traceability matrix [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: List wireframe screens/components and map to tasks/subtasks (2,3,6,7,8,9,10).
### Details:
Include paths: User-Facing App Wireframes 3/src/App.tsx, components/prism/*. Reference Figma URL in README.

## 2. Update acceptance criteria with wireframe references [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: For tasks 2,6,7,8,9, update acceptance to cite wireframe screen states (Timeline, Devices, Progress).
### Details:
Add references like “matches TimelineEditorScreen state A/B/C” and specific UI interactions.

## 3. Component inventory and design tokens alignment [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Inventory wireframe components (Radix UI set) and align with Studio components/tokens.
### Details:
List Accordion/Dialog/Slider/Select/Progress; confirm usage and theming match existing tokens.

## 4. Interaction parity checklist [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Document keyboard shortcuts, drag behaviors, and progress states from wireframes and ensure they appear in tasks 2/7/8/9.
### Details:
Capture Timeline scrubbing, zoom, device add/remove, progress cancel/retry, auto-play.
