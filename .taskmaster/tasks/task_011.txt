# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement REST endpoint routing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create URI handlers for all REST endpoints with proper HTTP methods
# Details:
Register handlers: POST /api/patterns (upload), GET /api/patterns (list), DELETE /api/patterns/:id (delete), POST /api/play (play), POST /api/playlist (playlist), GET /api/status (status). Use httpd_register_uri_handler() for each.

# Test Strategy:
Each endpoint responds with correct status code; test with curl for all HTTP methods
