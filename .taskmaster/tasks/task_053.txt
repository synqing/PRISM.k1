# Task ID: 53
# Title: Add node editor as experimental feature
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 50
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement node-based composition editor as advanced/experimental mode
# Details:
Node editor is FUTURE/EXPERIMENTAL feature, not part of primary workflow. Implement basic node graph UI for advanced users: effect nodes, palette nodes, parameter nodes, composition nodes. Should feel like Blender/TouchDesigner for LED patterns. Hide behind 'Advanced Mode' toggle or separate tab. Not required for 1.0 release - timeline editor is primary creation mode.

# Test Strategy:
Create simple 2-node graph, compile to .prism, verify output matches timeline-created pattern
