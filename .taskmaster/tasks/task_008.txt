# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement structural efficiency optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize .prism format size through structural efficiency: shared palettes, delta encoding, and hot cache
# Details:
Focus on structure-first approach rather than algorithm compression. Implement: (1) Shared palette system - reuse color palettes across patterns to reduce duplication, (2) Delta encoding for timeline keyframes - store differences between frames instead of absolute values, (3) Hot cache for frequently used patterns - keep popular patterns in RAM. Consider Heatshrink/gzip compression as optional later enhancement, not primary strategy. Target: reduce typical pattern size by 40-60% through structural efficiency alone.

# Test Strategy:
Create test patterns with repeated palettes and verify sharing reduces file size; test delta encoding produces correct playback; benchmark hot cache hit rates
