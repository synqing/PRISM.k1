# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement streaming upload handler
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create multipart upload handler with progress tracking and SHA256 verification
# Details:
Use httpd_req_recv() in chunks of 4KB. Write to temporary file in /prism/.upload/. Calculate SHA256 during upload. Verify against X-PRISM-SHA256 header. Atomic rename on success. Send progress via WebSocket if connected.

# Test Strategy:
Upload 50KB file, verify SHA256 matches; test interrupted upload cleanup; verify atomic commit
