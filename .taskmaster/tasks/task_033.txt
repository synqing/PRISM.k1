# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement memory profiling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31, 32
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add heap monitoring and leak detection
# Details:
Use esp_get_free_heap_size() monitoring. Track heap before/after operations. Use heap_caps_check_integrity_all() for corruption detection. Log warnings when heap drops below threshold.

# Test Strategy:
Run stress test for 1 hour, verify no memory leaks; heap remains stable
